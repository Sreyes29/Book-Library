# Book-Library
A simple web app that allows people to add and store books to a library. 
Users can borrow books and also reserve them in the library publicly for everyone to see. When a book is added to the database, the changes are reflected real time with no page refreshes. Built with Bootstrap on NodeJS server connected to a PostgreSQL database.
